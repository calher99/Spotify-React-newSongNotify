# Song Notify

I like keeping track of several Spotify Playlists and many times they add songs that I do not notice. I wanted to be able to play these songs while going in the car, doing sport and then if I liked them add them to any of my playlits, that's how this idea became an app.
The app is built using React, Express, and MongoDB, if you want to contribute send me a message and I help you out with the deployment!
